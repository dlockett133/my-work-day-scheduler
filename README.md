# My Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a dynamic scheduler that takes into consideration the user's working hours, and allows the user to store event/meeting details for that specific day for that specific hour.

Please Enjoy!

## Usage

When you first open this application, you are presented with a display of the current day of the week, date, and time. These are all being updated live.

Below you are presented with time-blocks that are from the hours of 9am-5pm. Depending on the time of day, you will see that that the time-blocks will have either a gray, orange, or green color. Each color represents if that specific time is in the past(gray), present(orange), or future(green).

To use this scheduler, all you have to do is click the text fields of any of the time-blocks and enter in your event/meeting details for that hour. Then you will click the save button on the right. This will save that specific meeting's detail in your local storage. Which will allow you to refresh your browser, and still have the details present on the page.
